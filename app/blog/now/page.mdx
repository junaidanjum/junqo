# Now

I spend my days deep in front-end development, refining UI/UX and exploring new ways to push design and performance. Lately, I’ve been experimenting with Swift and Framer Motion, always looking for ways to make interactions feel more fluid and engaging. It’s a constant cycle of learning, building, and fine-tuning.

I currently work as a Lead Software Architect at [Bell Energy](https://www.bell-energy.com/), where I focus on designing scalable solutions and optimizing workflows. It’s a mix of problem-solving and innovation, keeping me on my toes every day.

Outside of work, I write and read to keep my creativity alive. If you're into books, let’s connect on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/winterhexer).
